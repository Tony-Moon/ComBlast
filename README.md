# ComBlast

ComBlast is a mock example of creating a tool to check server health with Google Assistant. 
The end goal of this project is to create a GA app that can report on the upload speed, download speed and latency of any given server in your domain. 
I will be using my personal EC2s for this repo. 
Currently I am using an open source internet speed test built in Go.
Hopefully, I can transition into my own speed test, but at the moment that is not necessary.
