# Alpha Endpoint

The Alpha Endpoint is the EC2 of which we are monitoring health.
Ideally, we should just be able to download one executable file in any server, configure the server and forget about it.
Currently, there will be nothing but this md file in the server, because I am not using my own internet speed test. 
I am using showwin's go speed test, speedtest-go.
I highly recommend this speed test, as it is fast, easy to install and accurate.
